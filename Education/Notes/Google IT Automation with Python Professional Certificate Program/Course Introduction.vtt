00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.210
If you work in IT, computer programming
skills open up an incredible amount of

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.880
opportunity. Being able to write
scripts and programs that tell your

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.930
computer to perform a task equips you
with an invaluable tool.

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.550
Not only does it make your work easier
and more efficient, it can help you grow

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.790
faster and advance further in your IT
career.

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.420
But how do you even start to learn a
programming language like Python?

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.780
How do you recognize when to tell a
computer to perform a task?

8
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.180
And how do you then write a program to
actually get your computer to complete

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.350
the task you want it to do?

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760
The thought of learning to write a
program in Python can make you feel a

11
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.420
whole bunch of emotions, excitement,
anticipation, that feeling of wanting to

12
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.950
dive right in and get going and also
fear.

13
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.980
You might ask yourself, can I really
learn how to code or do I have it in me?

14
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.280
I'm here to tell you, yes, you can
absolutely do this.

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.490
Learning how to program can be scary
and intimidating, but at the same time

16
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.310
it's really fun and really exciting.

17
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.470
In coding as in life, if we're going to
get philosophical, the most rewarding

18
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.150
work is usually a bit challenging, but
ultimately well worth the effort.

19
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.550
Of course, I'm able to say all this
from experience, especially the cheesy

20
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.780
parts. My name is Christine Rafla.

21
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.360
I'm a systems administrator at Google
and I'm going to be your instructor and

22
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.370
guide in this course.

23
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.780
The role of a sysadmin can vary a lot
from company to company and even within

24
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.320
different teams in the same company.

25
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.790
I happen to work in the corporate
identity and access management

26
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.490
operations team, which is a really long
way of saying that we make sure that

27
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.320
everyone is represented correctly and
if they need to access certain

28
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.580
resources, they can.

29
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.990
What I love the most about being a
sysadmin is that the role has so many

30
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.060
diverse functions.

31
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.940
We handle loads of unique problems and
edge cases from tinkering with different

32
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.400
systems to collaborating with other
teams.

33
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.070
I am always learning something new, so
it's really hard to get bored.

34
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.660
It all starts with knowing how to
automate, if you're an IT support

35
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.790
specialist, a systems administrator, or
in a role somewhere in between knowing

36
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.140
how to get computers to do the hard
work for you will set you apart from

37
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.580
others in similar IT roles and make
your life much easier.

38
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.660
Think about it, would you rather
manually deploy 100 computers on your

39
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.050
own or tell your computer to do it all
for you all at once?

40
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.330
No-brainer, right, having a coding
skill set can help you grow into more

41
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.600
specialized roles like a systems
administrator, Cloud Solutions engineer,

42
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.970
DevOps specialist, site reliability
engineer, or who knows maybe even web

43
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.590
developer or data analyst.

44
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.240
The point is, being able to write a
program is an essential tool in your IT

45
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.240
toolkit and more and more employers are
looking for these skills in the people

46
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.140
they hire. If you've ever learned a new
skill, like playing a musical

47
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.640
instrument, speaking a foreign
language, knitting, or skateboarding.

48
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.400
You know that getting good at something
new requires a lot of practice.

49
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.740
For me, I love to learn new languages
and I'm proud to say I speak Spanish,

50
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.660
Arabic, French, and I even know ten
words in Russian.

51
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.520
Our world is shaped by the words and
the languages we speak and while some

52
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.700
words may be unique to one language you
can always find similarities that help

53
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.950
you learn and understand.

54
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.360
Being able to connect the dots between
cultures allows me to see things others

55
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.000
might not, kind of sounds like this
applies to IT programming, huh?

56
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.450
My point is, whether you're learning
French or Python, it's never easy.

57
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.010
You have to start small, learn the
basics and practice those until you

58
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.800
master them. Only then can you move on
to more complex and impressive stuff and

59
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.070
I'm here to help you along that path
along with my colleagues who you'll meet

60
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.370
in later courses. We'll start slow,
master the foundations together and

61
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.500
you'll soon be ready for more
challenging stuff.

62
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.830
So are you wondering why we filmed this
course in a cabin on a lake in Canada?

63
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.930
The truth is we're actually in a game
room at one of the Google offices in

64
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.100
Sunnyvale, California.

65
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.790
We chose a different themed office
space for each course of the program

66
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.390
just to mix things up and I think I
scored with this one.

67
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.890
I should warn my manager that I'll be
hanging out in this one well after the

68
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.940
course ends because it's super comfy.

69
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.660
By the end of this course, you'll
understand the benefits of programming

70
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.180
in IT roles. You'll be able to write
simple programs using Python, figure out

71
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.130
how the building blocks of programming
fit together, and combine all this

72
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.980
knowledge to solve a complex
programming problem.

73
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.910
That's right, by the end of this
course, you're going to write a program

74
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.930
in Python that's designed to solve a
real-world IT problem, super exciting

75
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.150
right? We'll start off by diving into
the basics of writing a computer

76
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.100
program. You'll get hands-on experience
with programming concepts through

77
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.310
interactive exercises and real-world
examples.

78
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.720
You'll quickly start to see how
computers can perform a multitude of

79
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.890
tasks. You just have to write code that
tells them what to do.

80
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.750
Along the way, we'll be talking about
automation, which is the process of

81
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.260
getting computers to automatically do a
task that us humans normally have to do

82
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.880
by hand. Now, some of the stuff can get
a little complex and confusing.

83
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.590
I promise to do my best to make these
lessons clear and easy to understand,

84
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.550
but if you get stuck at any point,
please feel free to re-watch the videos.

85
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.240
Practice as much as you like and take
the time you really need to understand

86
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.850
these topics. The goal of this course
isn't to teach you everything there is

87
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.060
to know about software engineering
because yikes, that would be a long

88
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.840
course. Instead, we're going to
introduce you to some of the key

89
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.280
concepts of programming and scripting
that will empower you to spot

90
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.280
opportunities for automation in real
life.

91
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.690
You're about to learn a skill that can
help you take your career to whole new

92
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.130
levels. Are you excited?

93
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.710
I'm excited, so let's jump in!
