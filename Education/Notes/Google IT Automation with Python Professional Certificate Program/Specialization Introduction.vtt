1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.400
Working in IT is more than just a job.

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.210
It's a career path. Research shows that
the field of IT support is a launchpad

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.060
for future career growth and better
wages.

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.330
In fact, a study on the subject was
recently conducted by the Harvard

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.950
Business School Accenture and Burning
Glass entitled Bridge the Gap.

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.680
It found that among today's
middle-skilled jobs which require

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.670
training but not a formal college
degree, IT support offers clear pathways

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.050
to prosperity. We saw this phenomenon
play out here at Google, in our IT

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.540
support program. Those who push
themselves to learn how to code in

10
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.030
Python typically saw strong career
growth.

11
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.020
They built skills that are critical to
accessing higher level positions in the

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.560
IT field, and after honing those skills
through hard work and determination,

13
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.420
they advanced into more technical IT
support specialists, systems

14
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.640
administrators, technical solutions
engineers, and even site reliability

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.060
engineers. The common thread across all
of these roles is knowing how to write

16
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.870
code to solve problems and automate
solutions.

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.340
By expanding your toolbox to include
coding skills, you open a window into

18
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.970
the world of systems management that
can lead you towards more advanced

19
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.370
technical roles down the line.

20
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.800
Python in particular is having a huge
surgence.

21
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.180
According to the 2019 Stack Overflow
Developer Survey, Python is the coding

22
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.880
language most people want to learn.

23
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.820
The second most loved by those who
already know it and the fourth most

24
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.060
popular overall. So why take this
program to learn how to code in Python?

25
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.300
Well, first it's geared towards people
who are already in or aspiring to be in

26
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.510
the field of IT. Maybe you're thinking
bigger about your current IT role and

27
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.170
want to work towards managing
operations at scale, or maybe you're

28
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.030
just starting out and looking to break
into the IT industry.

29
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.990
Perhaps you've taken our IT Support
Professional Certificate program on

30
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.860
Coursera already, or you have
equivalent IT support knowledge with

31
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.050
basic computing skills, like working
with files and directories, familiarity

32
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.060
with networking concepts, and
understanding how to install software on

33
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
your computer. In any case, this
program is tailor-made for you.

34
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.090
Second, this program offers three
hands-on methods of teaching coding and

35
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.830
Python and automation, code blocks,
Jupyter notebooks, and Qwiklabs.

36
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.330
Third, we've assembled an awesome group
of Googlers who will serve as your

37
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.570
instructors in each course.

38
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.940
They all started their careers in IT
support then learned programming and

39
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.180
moved onto more technical roles like
me.

40
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.520
We can't wait to share our stories with
you on how we use Python in our

41
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.310
day-to-day. Oh and hey, I should
probably introduce myself.

42
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.750
My name is Christine Rafla, and I'm a
Systems Administrator at Google.

43
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.600
I will be your instructor in this
course.

44
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.740
This program has been entirely designed
and developed by Google and we even

45
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.680
filmed each course at different cool
Google spaces.

46
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.900
It will introduce you to the Python
programming language with a special

47
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.880
focus on how this language applies to
automating tasks in the world of IT

48
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.900
systems support and administration.

49
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.990
I'm super excited to be here with you.

50
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.170
When I was younger, I had no idea that
careers in IT even existed.

51
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.110
There are a lot of reasons I wanted to
participate in the certificate program.

52
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.680
But one of my biggest motivations is
that I want to see more women

53
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.950
represented in the industry.

54
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.600
I remember going to a System
Administration Summit where there were

55
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.840
hundreds of men and about three women
that were sysadmins.

56
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.710
A lot has changed since then but
there's still so much we can do to bring

57
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.420
new ideas and representation into the
IT field.

58
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.220
That's why I want to share my knowledge
with as many people as possible.

59
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.390
I love my job and I love the people I
work with because they make it easy to

60
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.260
ask for help and offer their guidance.

61
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.650
This type of support network allows our
team and ultimately our industry to be

62
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.910
more successful. I understand from
experience that it can feel pretty

63
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.600
intimidating and maybe even a bit scary
to learn a coding language.

64
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.490
Just remember, everyone started where
you are right now with the first

65
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.800
command, the first script, and of
course, the first of many errors.

66
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.960
When I started out in my career, I
strived to get everything perfectly

67
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.280
right the first time I tried it.

68
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.220
But that actually slowed down my
progress.

69
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.550
So don't be afraid to make mistakes, it
will give you a leg up.

70
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.470
So let's get down to it.

71
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.120
What's ahead? The program begins with a
crash course in Python where you will

72
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.680
learn to write simple programs and
understand their role in automation.

73
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.890
Next, we'll get more hands-on focus on
how Python interacts with the operating

74
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.630
system. After that, we'll cover how to
use Git and GitHub to manage versions of

75
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.880
your code. Then we will focus on
troubleshooting and debugging techniques

76
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.300
to find and solve the root cause of
problems in IT infrastructure.

77
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.630
The next course covers automating at
scale where you will learn to deploy

78
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.640
configuration management on a fleet of
either physical or virtual machines

79
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.370
running in the Cloud. Last up, we will
bring all this knowledge together and

80
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.510
complete a final project designed to
solve tasks that you might encounter in

81
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.150
real-world IT settings.

82
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.210
Bonus, you can post your projects to
GitHub to show off your fancy new skills

83
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.430
to employers or friends or both.

84
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.690
That was a lot to rattle off.

85
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.080
Are you excited or what?

86
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.460
Now I'd like to quickly introduce you
to my fellow instructors who you will

87
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.970
get to meet along the way. Hey, my name
is Roger Martinez.

88
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.100
I'm a Linux System Administrator, and
I'll be your instructor in the course on

89
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.470
using Python's interacts with an
operating system.

90
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.430
Hi. I'm Kenny Sulma, and I'll be your
guide in the course about using Git and

91
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.340
GitHub to manage versions of your code.

92
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.740
Hi there. I'm Amanda Ballas, and I'll
be teaching you about troubleshooting

93
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.290
and debugging. Hey, I'm Phelan
Vendeville, and in my course, we'll

94
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.220
learn about Automation at scale using
Configuration Management and the Cloud.

95
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.320
Thanks everyone. This all-star team was
brought together to guide you on your

96
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.890
adventures in coding. You're in very
good hands.

97
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.990
Okay, I think that's everything.

98
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.210
Let's get ready to learn some new
skills and maybe even have some laughs

99
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.050
along the way. I'll see you in the next
video.
