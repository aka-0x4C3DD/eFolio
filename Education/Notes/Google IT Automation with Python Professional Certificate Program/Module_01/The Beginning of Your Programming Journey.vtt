00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.290
As the Chinese proverb says, a journey
of a thousand miles begins with a single

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.660
step. Today's a big day, you're taking
your first step in your journey to learn

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.210
how to write scripts in Python.

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.650
It's going to be a little challenging
at times, but really it's not that

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.670
scary. We'll go slow and give you
everything you need to fully grasp each

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.230
concept before we move along.

7
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.170
In the next few videos, you'll discover
the fundamental concepts of computer

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.880
programming. You'll learn what a
programming language is, what scripting

9
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.780
is, what languages are out there other
than Python, and how this all relates to

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.990
IT. We'll also have you coding before
you know it with small coding exercises

11
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.370
we've cooked up to give you hands-on
practice with Python.

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.450
This will include writing your very
first Python script.

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.320
But always keep in mind, if at any
point along the way you feel lost or

14
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.840
confused, don't panic.

15
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.860
You can watch the videos as many times
as you need to let the concept sink in,

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.350
plus you can ask questions in the
discussion forums, which is one of the

17
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.710
best ways to find extra information and
connect with other learners.

18
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.920
When I was asked to participate in this
program, it made me think about when I

19
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.140
first started to code.

20
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.400
If I could give that younger version of
myself a piece of advice, this is what I

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.660
would tell her, it never works the
first time.

22
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.520
Seriously, as a newbie, I expected it
all to work like magic.

23
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.110
I thought that following the rules and
getting it right the first time would

24
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.900
prove my value as a coder, but that's
just not true, not even the best of the

25
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.520
best. If you expect to write perfect
code on the first shot you're going to

26
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.520
be disappointed. You hear that younger
self?

27
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.520
Try not to feel overwhelmed by the
details.

28
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.830
Connecting the dots only comes with
experience, so the best way to learn is

29
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.950
to just jump in.

30
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.540
The truth is everyone learns at their
own pace.

31
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.480
If you already know some of these
concepts, feel free to skip ahead to the

32
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.790
parts that interests you the most.

33
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.470
If you're starting from scratch, take
as long as you need for each concept.

34
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.090
The assessments will be right there
waiting for you when you're done, and if

35
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.460
at any point you start doubting
yourself, remember, even the most

36
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.590
advanced programmers started thinking,
Python?

37
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.280
What's Python? Well, we're about to
learn all about it, so let's dive in.

38
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.400
Next up, we'll be doing a rundown of
what programming is.
