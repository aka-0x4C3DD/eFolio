00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.370
Although we picked Python for this
course, it's important to note that it's

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.770
just one of the many coding languages
out there.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.610
Think of a given programming language
as just one of the many powerful tools

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.930
in your IT toolbox.

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.120
Each language has its unique set of
pros and cons.

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.680
Some run faster than others.

7
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.350
Some are better suited for enterprise
applications.

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.730
Others are particularly good at
crunching numbers.

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.840
There are platform-specific scripting
languages like PowerShell which is used

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.750
on Windows, and Bash which is used on
Linux.

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.920
Both are widely used by system
administrators on those platforms.

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.720
There are also general-purpose
scripting languages similar to Python,

13
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.880
like Perl or Ruby, which are also
widely used for scripting and

14
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.210
automation. JavaScript, which was
originally developed as a client-side

15
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.880
scripting language for the web, is
increasingly used server-side for a

16
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.090
broader set of tasks.

17
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.730
And the list doesn't stop there.

18
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.500
There's a vast array of traditional
languages to explore like C, C++, Java,

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.680
or Go. As you progress in your career
in IT, you'll probably encounter a

20
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.650
number of different languages and learn
when to use each of them.

21
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.360
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

22
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.420
First, we have Python to get our heads
around.

23
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.470
A nice feature of learning the basics
of programming in one language is that

24
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.320
you can generally apply the same
concepts you learn to other languages.

25
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.080
This means that once you're familiar
with Python, you'll find it easier to

26
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.650
pick up new coding languages as you'll
spot and understand similarities and

27
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.790
differences between them.

28
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.780
After all, every language needs to do
some common things like create

29
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.720
variables, control the flow of a
program, read input, and display output,

30
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.740
even if they do these tasks using
different approaches.

31
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.290
As we called out earlier, learning a
programming language is somewhat similar

32
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.700
to learning a foreign language.

33
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.940
You'll need to grasp the syntax and
semantics for that language.

34
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.190
Luckily for us, once you know the
fundamentals of programming, learning

35
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.730
another language is much easier than
learning a second foreign language.

36
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.350
There are a lot more similarities
between programming languages than

37
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.120
differences. To explore some of the
similarities and differences between

38
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.100
various scripting languages, let's take
a look at a simple program that prints

39
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.480
the words hello world ten times in
three different languages, Python, Bash,

40
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.100
and PowerShell. As you can see, each
language uses a different approach to

41
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.460
printing hello world.

42
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.070
But look closer and you'll see
similarities too.

43
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.800
Each language must somehow put text
onto the screen.

44
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.470
The command for Python is print, for
Bash it's Echo, and for PowerShell it's

45
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.650
Write-Host. Also notice that each
language has to count to ten in some

46
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.540
way. While Python does this by
specifying range(10), Bash uses a

47
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.430
sequence notation to count from 1 to
10.

48
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.320
PowerShell has the most complex syntax
in this example, but it also boils down

49
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.270
to starting at 1 and counting up to 10.

50
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.110
So as we've just seen there's a whole
lot of programming languages out there,

51
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.450
but don't let that scare you.

52
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.330
In this course, you will only need to
focus on learning Python.

53
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.650
Once you can speak Python you can go on
to learn any other language you want.

54
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.530
Up next, we've got another quiz to help
you practice what you've just learned.
