00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.890
There's a ton of things that you can do
with Python and you'll learn many of

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.790
them in this course. But before we dive
into complex subjects, let's have some

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.100
fun with another simple task that you
can do with Python.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.830
We are going to make Python our
calculator.

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.410
Let's start with something easy.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.610
So 4 plus 5 is 9, 9 times 7 is 63,
minus 1 divided by 4 is minus 0.25.

7
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.320
Easy. Repeating or periodic numbers are
printed in a longer format.

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.460
Let's try 1 divided by 3.

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.420
In math theory, when 1 is divided by 3,
the digit 3 repeats forever after the

10
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.060
decimal point. Of course, it's hard to
display something that repeats forever.

11
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.690
So instead, we have a representation
showing lots of decimal places.

12
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.110
Not too hard, right? Let's get the
computer something a bit trickier.

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.280
Let's say we want to divide 2050 by 5,
then subtract 32 and then divide the

14
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.640
result by 9. To do this, we'll need to
use parentheses, just as we do in

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.790
typical math problems.

16
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.910
You can also use Python to get squares,
cubes, or any power of n of a number.

17
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.490
For example, let's say we want to find
out what 2 to the power of 10 is.

18
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.250
To get Python to give us the answer, we
use the double star operator.

19
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.750
If you're starting to worry that this
is becoming an algebra course, relax.

20
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.350
We're not going to do anything more
complex than what we've just seen.

21
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.260
If you're thinking, "Why would I use
Python instead of just a normal

22
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.910
calculator?" That's a valid question.

23
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.080
Experimenting in this way, you get
familiar with the language's math

24
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.350
capabilities. In IT jobs, there are
many tasks that require you to use math

25
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.080
calculations. You might need to count
how many times a certain word appears in

26
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.620
a text, or work out the average time it
takes for an operation to complete, or

27
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.940
how much you have to compress an image
to fit in certain size constraints.

28
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.550
Whatever you need to calculate, writing
a script can help you do it faster and

29
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.080
with more accuracy. So you need to know
what mathematical operations are

30
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.600
available to you. Python actually has a
lot more advanced numeric capabilities

31
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.180
that are used for data analysis,
statistics, machine learning, and other

32
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.380
scientific applications.

33
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.670
We won't get into these in this course.

34
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.550
But if you want to learn more about
them on your own, there's a wealth of

35
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.950
online resources available.

36
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.190
Next up, a cheat sheet to help you with
programming concepts that we've just

37
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.730
covered. After that, it's time for
another quiz.

38
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.840
This time with a few small coding
exercises.

39
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.150
Remember, if something is unclear, you
can re-watch the videos as many times as

40
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.490
you need. Ready?

41
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.810
You've got this.
