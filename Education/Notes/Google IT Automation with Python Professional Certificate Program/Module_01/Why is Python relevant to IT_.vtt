00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.330
Remember how we mentioned that Python is
simple and easy to use?

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.650
Python makes it easy to express the
fundamental concepts of programming like

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.200
data structures and algorithms with
easy to read syntax.

4
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.490
This makes Python a great language to
use to learn programming.

5
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.130
And there are other reasons to pick
Python, too.

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.800
Python is super popular in the IT
industry, making it one of the most

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.520
common programming languages used
today.

8
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.340
Python isn't new. Its first version was
released by Guido van Rossum back in

9
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.960
1991. Since then, the community that
develops it has grown and the language

10
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.160
has advanced a lot.

11
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.290
Whenever there's a significant change
to the semantics or syntax of the

12
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.290
language, a new major version is
released.

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.630
In 2000, Python 2 was released.

14
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.560
In 2008, we got Python 3.

15
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.160
In this course, we'll use Python 3.7,
which came out in 2018.

16
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.800
For many years, Python was considered a
beginner's language and was mostly used

17
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.690
for teaching concepts or writing very
small simple scripts, like in this

18
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.600
course. But in recent years, the
adoption of Python has grown

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.540
dramatically. One reason for this is
that the language has become more

20
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.270
powerful. It's also because there's
more tools available in Python for a

21
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.870
growing range of applications.

22
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.020
You can use Python to calculate
statistics, run your e-commerce site,

23
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.810
process images, interact with web
services, and do a whole host of other

24
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.890
tasks. Python is perfect for
automation.

25
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.080
It lets you automate everyday tasks by
writing simple scripts that are easy to

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.980
understand and easy to maintain.

27
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.220
That's why Python is the language of
choice for lots of people working in IT

28
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.300
support, system administration, and web
development.

29
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.220
Not only that, but it's also used in
fast-growing areas of IT, like machine

30
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.630
learning or data analytics.

31
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.040
Last but not least, Python is available
for download on a wide variety of

32
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.400
operating systems, like Windows, Linux,
and Mac OS.

33
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.570
And what's more, Python is so popular
in the workplace that if you are

34
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.060
currently working in IT, you've most
likely encountered it already.

35
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.330
And if you're planning a career in IT,
chances are you'll interact with Python

36
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.740
quite a bit. So there's a whole lot of
reasons for why Python is relevant to

37
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.140
today's IT industry.

38
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.310
A large part of programming is learning
through trial and error and asking

39
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.090
questions. So if at any point you get
stuck, don't get discouraged.

40
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.370
Making mistakes helps you improve.

41
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.600
The more you see failure or broken code
as an opportunity to learn, the quicker

42
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.980
you'll master programming.

43
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.350
I remember the first Python script I
ever wrote.

44
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.460
It took a lot of refactoring,
debugging, and testing to get it to

45
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.820
work. I relied on a lot of my teammates
for help and mentorship and wound up

46
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.680
spending more time on Stack Overflow
than actually writing the code.

47
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.490
Thankfully, you don't have to reinvent
the wheel.

48
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.230
There's almost always someone on the
Internet who's trying to do what you're

49
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.920
doing and can help point you in the
right direction when you're stuck.

50
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.090
Sometimes it takes a village.

51
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.330
It's really important to keep in mind
that even experienced programmers may

52
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.020
need to ask a colleague a question from
time to time or look something up on the

53
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.650
Internet. Whether you're a programming
novice or have some experience in

54
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.970
software development, remember, the
best programmers overcome challenges by

55
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.420
seeking help or using other resources.

56
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.620
Once you've completed this program,
you'll be well on your way to

57
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.350
confidently programming in basic
Python.

58
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.860
There's lots of information online that
will help you continue to develop your

59
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.170
programming skills. For example, there
are lots of online courses for specific

60
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.270
programming languages.

61
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.940
You'll find answers to your Python
coding questions in the official Python

62
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.100
documentation. You can use sites like
Stack Overflow to discuss and share with

63
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.570
other developers. And you can ask
questions in our discussion forums.

64
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.640
You can even subscribe to some of the
Python mailing lists to keep in the know

65
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.450
on the latest updates to the language.

66
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.030
You're opening the door to the whole
world of programming, and it's super

67
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.090
exciting to be joining the development
community.

68
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.900
The most important thing to remember is
that you're never alone.

69
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.390
Any questions you may have, any time in
your career, there are resources out

70
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.850
there to help you find the answers you
need.

71
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.650
Wow, that was a lot of information.

72
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.610
Feel free to take a quick break, grab
something to drink, and then head on

73
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.500
over to the supplemental reading to
learn more about Python and the

74
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.220
resources out there to help you learn.
