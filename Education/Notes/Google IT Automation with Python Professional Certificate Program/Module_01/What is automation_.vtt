00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.010
Although we might not realize it, we
reap the benefits of automation all the

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.290
time in our daily lives.

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.370
Do you ever pay your bills with
scheduled payments or use a self check

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.430
out at the grocery store?

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.280
I always set my coffee machine to start
brewing before I've even gotten out of

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.840
bed. The promise of fresh coffee makes
early mornings way easier.

7
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.430
Automation is the process of replacing
a manual step with one that happens

8
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.020
automatically. Take a traffic light for
example, which continuously regulates

9
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.170
the flow of vehicles at an
intersection.

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.240
A traffic light requires human
intervention only when it needs repairs

11
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.980
or maintenance. The automatic
regulation of traffic means that humans

12
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.990
don't have to stand at the intersection
manually signaling when cars should stop

13
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.920
or go. Instead, people can concentrate
on more complex, creative, or difficult

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.820
tasks like focusing on where you're
driving.

15
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.240
What's more, traffic lights don't get
tired, bored, or accidentally display a

16
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.690
green light when they mean red.

17
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.370
This highlights another benefit of
automation consistency.

18
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.580
Let's face it, us humans are flawed and
sometimes we make mistakes, a human

19
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.820
performing the same tasks hundreds of
times will never be as consistent as a

20
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.310
machine doing the same thing.

21
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.650
But for all of its advantages
automation isn't a solution for every

22
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.520
situation, some tasks just aren't
suited for automation.

23
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.820
For example, they may require a degree
of creativity or flexibility that

24
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.910
automatic systems can't provide or for
more complicated or less frequently

25
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.940
executed tasks creating the automation
may actually be more effort or cost than

26
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.790
it's worth. Think about when you get a
haircut.

27
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.060
What would it take to automate the
actions of cutting hair with a machine?

28
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.310
The client's height, the shape of their
head, their current hair length, and

29
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.570
desired hairstyle would all need to be
taken into account when designing the

30
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.990
automatic system. We need to replicate
the creativity and skills of a trained

31
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.100
specialist along with extensive testing
to ensure the clients safety and quality

32
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.010
haircut. And if you've ever had a bad
experience at a hair salon, you know

33
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.110
quality can be subjective.

34
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.530
In this case, the cost and effort of
automation just isn't worth the benefits

35
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.270
of an automatic haircut would provide
which is why we don't have robot

36
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.080
hairstylists. Not too complex, right?

37
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.010
Automation is a powerful tool when used
in the right place at the right moment.

38
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.900
It can save time, reduce errors,
increase consistency, and provide a way

39
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.430
to centralize solutions and mistakes,
making them easier to fix.

40
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.440
Throughout this course, and in upcoming
ones we'll be talking about when it

41
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.580
makes sense to apply automation and
exactly how you do it.

42
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.900
Eventually knowing when and where to
use automation will become automatic for

43
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.970
you.
