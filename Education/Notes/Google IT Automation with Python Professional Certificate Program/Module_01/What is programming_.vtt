00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.260
At a basic level, a computer program is
a recipe of instructions that tells your

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.400
computer what to do.

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.730
When you write a program, you create a
step by step recipe of what needs to be

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.390
done to complete a task and when your
computer executes the program it reads

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.010
what you wrote and follows your
instructions to the letter.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.420
How nice is that?

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.720
The recipe is written in a code called
programming language.

8
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.830
Programming languages are actually
similar to humans spoken languages since

9
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.020
they have a syntax and semantics.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.840
Now if it's been awhile since your last
grammar class, here's a quick refresher

11
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.220
on syntax and semantics.

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.260
In a human language, syntax is the
rules for how a sentence is constructed

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.720
while semantics refers to the actual
meaning of the statements.

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.860
In English, sentences generally have
both a subject, that's a person, place,

15
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.050
or thing and a predicate, usually a
verb and a statement that explains what

16
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.410
the subject is doing. Let's take the
sentence, Paula loves to program in

17
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.820
Python as an example.

18
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.190
In this sentence, Paula is the subject
and loves to program in Python is the

19
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.900
predicate. To form a sentence that
others can understand, you need to know

20
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.960
both the syntax that constructs the
sentence and the semantics that gives it

21
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.030
meaning. The same applies to
programming languages.

22
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.880
In a programming language like Python,
the syntax is the rules for how each

23
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.550
instruction is written and the
semantics is the effects the

24
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.110
instructions have. Much like spoken
languages, there are lots of programming

25
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.200
languages to choose from.

26
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.660
Each has its own history, features, and
applications but they all share the same

27
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.780
fundamental ideas.

28
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.390
So once you understand the basic
concepts in one programming language, it

29
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.260
becomes much easier to learn another.

30
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.800
Lastly, computers always do exactly
what they're told.

31
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.970
So when you write a program, it's
important to be super clear about what

32
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.360
you want the computer to do.

33
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.420
Learning the syntax and semantics of
the programming language you choose will

34
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.210
allow you to do just that.

35
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.600
Make sense? Before we continue, let's
spend a moment on terminology.

36
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.560
In the next few videos you'll hear the
term script being used a bunch.

37
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.910
So what's the difference between a
script and a program?

38
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.840
The line between the two can be a bit
blurry.

39
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.190
In this course, we'll use the terms
interchangeably.

40
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.680
In general, you can think of scripts as
programs with a short development cycle

41
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.260
that can be created and deployed
rapidly.

42
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.180
In other words, a script is a program
that is short, simple, and can be

43
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.400
written very quickly. In this course
we'll focus on a specific scripting

44
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.140
language called python which we'll use
to learn the basics of programming.

45
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.660
We'll learn about the python syntax,
the rules of how to write a python

46
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.640
program, and the semantics or meaning
of the different pieces involved.

47
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.870
Before we start learning how to code
and having you write your first python

48
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.980
script, let's talk more about what
automation is and why it's useful.
