00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.350
Welcome back. How did you do on your
first quiz?

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.220
If you got most of the questions right,
great job.

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.800
If not, no worries it's all part of
learning.

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.470
We'll be here to help you check that
you've really got your head around these

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.010
concepts with regular quizzes like
this.

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.540
If you ever find a question tricky, go
back and review the videos and then try

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.940
the quiz again. You want to feel super
comfortable with what you've learned

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.530
before jumping into the next lesson.

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.330
Remember, take your time.

10
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.570
I will be here whenever you're ready to
move on.

11
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.940
Okay. Feeling good? Great.

12
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.090
Let us dive in. In this course, we will
use the Python programming language to

13
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.550
demonstrate basic programming concepts
and how to apply them to writing

14
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.890
scripts. We have mentioned that there
are a bunch of programming languages out

15
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.350
there. So why pick Python?

16
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.410
Well, we chose Python for a few
reasons.

17
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.740
First off, programming in Python
usually feels similar to using a human

18
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.040
language. This is because Python makes
it easy to express what we want to do

19
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.280
with syntax that's easy to read and
write.

20
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.230
Check out this example. There is a lot
to unpack here so don't worry if you

21
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.770
don't understand it right away, we'll
get into the nitty-gritty details later

22
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.510
in the course. But even if you've never
seen a line of code before, you might be

23
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.430
able to guess what this code does.

24
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.050
It defines a list with names of friends
and then creates a greeting for each

25
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.840
name in the list. Now it is your turn
to make friends with Python.

26
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.600
Try it out and see what happens.

27
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.370
Throughout this course, you will
execute Python code using your web

28
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.080
browser. We'll start with some small
coding exercises using code blocks just

29
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.780
like the one you experimented with.

30
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.450
Later on as you develop your skills,
you'll work on larger more complex

31
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.320
coding exercises using other tools.

32
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.440
Getting good at something takes a whole
lot of practice and programming and

33
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.510
Python is no different.

34
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.670
We recommend that you practice every
example we share in this course on your

35
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.810
own. If you do not have Python
installed on your machine, no worries,

36
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.920
you can still practice using an online
Python interpreter.

37
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.860
Check out the next reading for links to
the most popular Python interpreters

38
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.830
available online. Now I am sure you are
wondering what the heck is a Python

39
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.050
interpreter. In programming, an
interpreter is the program that reads

40
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.230
and executes code.

41
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.480
Remember how we said a computer program
is like a recipe with step-by-step

42
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.320
instructions? Well, if your recipe is
written in Python, the Python

43
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.350
interpreter is the program that reads
what is in the recipe and translates it

44
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.100
into instructions for your computer to
follow.

45
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.670
Eventually, you'll want to install
Python on your computer so you can run

46
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.960
it locally and experiment with it as
much as you like.

47
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.080
We'll guide you through how to install
Python in the upcoming course but you

48
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.740
don't have to have it installed to get
your first taste of Python.

49
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.800
You can practice with the quizzes we
provide and with the online interpreters

50
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.590
and code pads that we'll give you links
to in the next reading.

51
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.200
We'll provide a whole bunch of
exercises for you but feel free to come

52
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.640
up with your own and share them in the
discussion forums.

53
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.290
Feel free to get creative.

54
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.390
This is your chance to show off your
new skills.
